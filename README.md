# sqlalchemy-challenge

This assignment allowed me to combine my knowledge of SQL and Python to analyze weather data in Hawaii to plan a vacation.

About the dataset: The dataset contained information regarding weather stations in Hawaii and data in those areas regarding temperature and precipitation.

I studied and analyzed the precipitation and temperatures given within a specific date range.

I had to leverage the power of SQLAlchemy in order to reflect the tables from the databases into classes. This allows for the ability to work with the data in Python.
